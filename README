The project is organized in 'tests' folder and 'pages'. 
In Pages you can find the new page or tab that is being opened. So far, there is only one. 

In order to run the tests, under tests forlder, open the only existing test so far, called singUpUser.spec.js.
In the terminal run the command: npm run test --ui  -> this will open a new window where you can select your test and visually see what your test is doing. 
Another way to run the test is by opening the terminal and run the command: npx playwright test.
